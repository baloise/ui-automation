The Custom control type covers a multitude of non-standard controls. Mostly these have been wrapped up in a single 
type - Custom, but where specific implementations are known, then sub-classes of Custom have been created - for 
example [Word](word.md) has a AutomationDocumentPage, which is different enough
 from a standard Custom 
control to have a specific implementation.
